# Image Deformation

## Overview

An implemenation of Image Deformation using Moving Least Squares, Schaefer et. al. as the final project for CSC 301 Numerical Issues in Scientific Computing (CCNY Spring 2018). The implemenation focused on implementing the affine transformation for deformation due to time constraints on the project. An interface is included to allow a user to select and drag control points to deform an image. However, this deformation is not live as it takes approximately 30 seconds to complete the interpolations and matrix operations involved in performing the deformation.
